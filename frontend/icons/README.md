# PWA Icons Directory

This directory contains PWA icons for different screen sizes.

For development and testing, you'll need to:

1. Create or download icons in the following sizes:
   - icon-192x192.png (192x192 pixels) - Standard PWA icon
   - icon-512x512.png (512x512 pixels) - High-resolution icon

2. Recommended icon design:
   - Dark background (#000000)
   - CalorieSnap branding (#4A90E2)
   - Simple camera or food-related imagery
   - Transparent or no background shadows for better PWA integration

During development, the app will work without icons, but PWA installation and app store submission require proper icons.

- https://fontawesome.com/ (camera and food icons)
- Custom design using Figma, Canva, or similar tools
